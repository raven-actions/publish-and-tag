> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a heavily modified fork project of the [build-and-tag-action](https://github.com/JasonEtco/build-and-tag-action), which looks like is stale.

A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) for properly publishing and tagging GitHub Actions (`JavaScript` / `TypeScript`, `Docker`, `Composite`)! It's designed to act on new releases and updates the tag only with necessary files. The process looks like this:

- Reads the `main` property in your `package.json`
- Reads the `files` property in your `package.json` to include additional files in your release (optional)
- Force pushes `action.yml` or `action.yaml` and additional files to the release's tag
- Force pushes to the major and minor version tag (ex: `v1.0.0` -> `v1.0` and `v1`) (optional)

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Prerequisites

#### JavaScript (TypeScript) Action

> This repository even uses it! `@vercel/ncc` supports TypeScript out of the box üòç So, no need to include your `dist/` in the git.

The two important things you'll need to set in your action are the `main` field and the `build` script. Here's an example of a minimal `package.json` that will use `@vercel/ncc` to compile your action to `dist/index.js`, and update your `action.yml` or `action.yaml` file to use the `node16` runtime, and point `publish-and-tag` action at the compiled file.

Example `package.json` for your project:

```json
{
  "name": "your-action-name",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npx @vercel/ncc build"
  }
  // rest of your package.json properties
}
```

Your `package.json` will probably contain a `dependencies` section and other fields such as `license`, etc...

#### Docker Action

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Docker Action support is experimental. Use with caution!

By default, Docker Action does not need `package.json`, but for `publish-and-tag` action is required as a kind of manifest file for publishing. The only `main` and `files` (optional) properties should be placed into `package.json`.

```json
{
  "main": "docker",
  "files": [
    // Optional if your docker action uses a container registry pointer without any extra files
    "Dockerfile",
    "entrypoint.sh"
  ]
}
```

#### Composite Action

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Composite Action support is experimental. Use with caution!

By default Composite Action does not need `package.json`, but for `publish-and-tag` action is required as a kind of manifest file for publishing. The only `main` and `files` (optional) properties should be placed into `package.json`.

```json
{
  "main": "composite",
  "files": [
    // Optional if your composite action does not use any files
    "main.js",
    "entrypoint.sh"
  ]
}
```

### Quick Start

```yaml
name: Publish

on:
  release:
    types: [published, edited]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}

      - name: Install dependencies  # ‚ö†Ô∏è Not required for Composite and Docker Actions! keep only for JavaScript/TypeScript Action
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build  # ‚ö†Ô∏è Not required for Composite and Docker Actions! keep only for JavaScript/TypeScript Action
        run: npm run build

      - name: Publish and Tag Action
        uses: raven-actions/publish-and-tag@v1
```

### Additional configuration

You can also use this action with other events - you'll need to specify a `tag_name` (see [üì• Inputs](#-inputs) section below).

Optionally you can set the `files` property in your `package.json` with the list of the additional files that should be included in your release. Yes, it supports `globs`!

In the `files`, you do not have to include action manifest files (`action.yml` / `action.yaml`) or file pointed into `main`. Both are included by default. Nothing wrong will happen if any of those files are included in the files, for example, with globs. publish-and-tag action will filter it.

```json
{
  "name": "your-action-name",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npx @vercel/ncc build"
  },
  "files": [
    "dist/additional.js",
    "extras/*",
    "LICENSE",
    "README.md"
  ]
  // rest of your package.json properties
}
```

## üì• Inputs

All inputs are `optional`.

## üèóÔ∏è Project changes - fork vs source

- Support for additional files to include: `files` property in `package.js`
- The `glob` support for additional files
- Custom git commit message support
- Custom git author/committer support
- Option to control update or not major and minor tags
- Option to cleanup action manifest file
- Option to mark the release as `latest` (and change from prerelease to full release)
- GitHub token is automatically injected into the action; no need to specify `env` explicitly
- Outputs with version, git commit sha, and basic release details
- Auto-discovery action manifest file: `action.yml` or `action.yaml`
- Docker and Composite Actions support `‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental. Use with caution!`
- Chmod 755 for executable files used in Docker or Composite Actions (only works on `.sh` and `.bash` extensions) `‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental. Use with caution!`
- Renamed to `Publish and Tag`, because the action does not perform build, but rather packaging/publishing

## üòé Motivation

I am fully aligned with Jason's motivation, but I missed a few functionalities in his action - I couldn't find an alternative in the GitHub marketplace as well. I wanted to have one consistent mechanism for action publishing.

Missing features have been introduced in this forked project. See [üèóÔ∏è Project changes - fork vs source](#Ô∏è-project-changes---fork-vs-source) section for more details.

> Jason's motivation
>
> The [guide to JavaScript Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-javascript-action) recommends including `node_modules` in your repository, and manual steps to [following the versioning recommendations](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md#versioning). There are anti-patterns there that just don't sit right with me; so we can enable the same workflow, automatically!
>
> This Action is heavily inspired by [mheap/github-action-auto-compile-node](https://github.com/mheap/github-action-auto-compile-node) & [Actions-R-Us/actions-tagger](https://github.com/Actions-R-Us/actions-tagger). This is more or less a combination of those two Actions, meant to work together.
